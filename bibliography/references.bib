Forest harvesting operations have been traditionally considered physically demanding and potentially dangerous, with forest workers on foot exposed to heavy and fast-moving trees, logs and machinery. Many tasks in forestry have already been mechanised to reduce hazards to the worker and increase productivity. For example, the axe was replaced by the chainsaw, which was replaced by the harvester. Workers on log landings have been displaced by delimbing machines and breakers-out by grapple carriages.},

Treebot's body is a novel continuum maneuver structure that has high degrees of freedom and superior extension ability. Treebot also equips with a pair of omni-directional tree grippers that enable Treebot to adhere on a wide variety of trees with a wide range of gripping curvature. By combining these two novel designs, Treebot is able to reach many places on trees including branches. Treebot can maneuver on a complex tree environment, but only five actuators are used in the mechanism. As a result, Treebot can keep in compact size and lightweight. Although Treebot weighs only 600 grams, it has payload capability of 1.75 kg which is nearly three times of its own weight. On top of that, the special design of the gripper permits zero energy consumption in static gripping. Numerous experiments have been conducted on real trees. Experimental results reveal that Treebot has excellent climbing performance on a wide variety of trees.},

Our harvester performs a challenging task of autonomous navigation and tree grabbing in a confined, GPS denied forest environment. Strategies for mapping, localization, planning, and control are proposed and integrated into a fully autonomous system. The mission starts with a human mapping the area of interest using a custom-made sensor module. Subsequently, a human expert selects the trees for harvesting. The sensor module is then mounted on the machine and used for localization within the given map. A planning algorithm searches for both an approach pose and a path in a single path planning problem. We design a path following controller leveraging the legged harvester's capabilities for negotiating rough terrain. Upon reaching the approach pose, the machine grabs a tree with a general-purpose gripper. This process repeats for all the trees selected by the operator. Our system has been tested on a testing field with tree trunks and in a natural forest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this level of autonomy has been shown on a full-size hydraulic machine operating in a realistic environment.},

The SlothBot is a solar-powered, slow-paced, energy-efficient robot-hence its name-capable of moving on a mesh of wires by switching between branching wires. Unlike ground mobile robots or aerial robots employed in environmental monitoring applications, the use of wire-traversing robots allows for longer-term deployment because of the significantly lower energy consumption. Wire-traversing, coupled with the use of solar panels, facilitates the self-sustainability of the SlothBot. Locomotion and wire-switching maneuvers are performed in a fail-safe fashion, inasmuch the robot is always firmly attached to the wires, even when switching between branching wires. This is achieved by employing a two-body structure featuring an actuated decoupling mechanism. In this paper we show the design and the motion control of the SlothBot, together with the results of long-term monitoring experiments.},

        abstract = {Natural rubber is widely used in human life because of its excellent quality. At present, manual tapping is still the main way to obtain natural rubber. There is a sore need for intelligent tapping devices in the tapping industry, and the autonomous navigation technique is of great importance to make rubber-tapping devices intelligent. To realize the autonomous navigation of the intelligent rubber-tapping platform and to collect information on a rubber forest, the sparse point cloud data of tree trunks are extracted by the low-cost LiDAR and a gyroscope through the clustering method. The point cloud is fitted into circles by the Gauss-Newton method to obtain the center point of each tree. Then, these center points are threaded through the Least Squares method to obtain the straight line, which is regarded as the navigation path of the robot in this forest. Moreover, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm is adopted to obtain the robot's position. In a forest with different row spacings and plant spacings, the heading error and lateral error of this robot are analyzed and a Fuzzy Controller is applied for the following activities: walking along one row with a fixed lateral distance, stopping at fixed points, turning from one row into another, and collecting information on plant spacing, row spacing, and trees' diameters. Then, according to the collected information, each tree's position is calculated, and the geometric feature map is constructed. In a forest with different row spacings and plant spacings, three repeated tests have been carried out at an initial speed of 0.3 m/s. The results show that the Root Mean Square (RMS) lateral errors are less than 10.32 cm, which shows that the proposed navigation method provides great path tracking. The fixed-point stopping range of the robot can meet the requirements for automatic rubber tapping of the mechanical arm, and the average stopping error is 12.08 cm. In the geometric feature map constructed by collecting information, the RMS radius errors are less than 0.66 cm, and the RMS plant spacing errors are less than 11.31 cm. These results show that the method for collecting information and constructing a map recursively in the process of navigation proposed in the paper provides a solution for forest information collection. The method provides a low-cost, real-time, and stable solution for forest navigation of automatic rubber tapping equipment, and the collected information not only assists the automatic tapping equipment to plan the tapping path, but also provides a basis for the informationization and precise management of a rubber plantation.},

Motivated by this, we present an online LiDAR system which can run on a handheld device to segment and track individual trees and identify them in a fixed coordinate system. Segments relating to each tree are accumulated over time, and tree models are completed as more scans are captured from different perspectives. Using this reconstruction we then fit a cylinder model to each tree trunk by solving a least-squares optimisation over the points to estimate the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of the trees. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can estimate DBH to within \${\textbackslash}sim\$7 cm accuracy for 90\% of individual trees in a forest (Wytham Woods, Oxford)},
