Many tasks in forestry have already been mechanised to reduce hazards to the worker and increase productivity. For example, the axe was replaced by the chainsaw, which was replaced by the harvester. Workers on log landings have been displaced by delimbing machines and breakers-out by grapple carriages.},

Treebot's body is a novel continuum maneuver structure that has high degrees of freedom and superior extension ability. Treebot also equips with a pair of omni-directional tree grippers that enable Treebot to adhere on a wide variety of trees with a wide range of gripping curvature. By combining these two novel designs, Treebot is able to reach many places on trees including branches. Treebot can maneuver on a complex tree environment, but only five actuators are used in the mechanism. As a result, Treebot can keep in compact size and lightweight. Although Treebot weighs only 600 grams, it has payload capability of 1.75 kg which is nearly three times of its own weight. On top of that, the special design of the gripper permits zero energy consumption in static gripping. Numerous experiments have been conducted on real trees. Experimental results reveal that Treebot has excellent climbing performance on a wide variety of trees.},

Our harvester performs a challenging task of autonomous navigation and tree grabbing in a confined, GPS denied forest environment. Strategies for mapping, localization, planning, and control are proposed and integrated into a fully autonomous system. The mission starts with a human mapping the area of interest using a custom-made sensor module. Subsequently, a human expert selects the trees for harvesting. The sensor module is then mounted on the machine and used for localization within the given map. A planning algorithm searches for both an approach pose and a path in a single path planning problem. We design a path following controller leveraging the legged harvester's capabilities for negotiating rough terrain. Upon reaching the approach pose, the machine grabs a tree with a general-purpose gripper. This process repeats for all the trees selected by the operator. Our system has been tested on a testing field with tree trunks and in a natural forest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this level of autonomy has been shown on a full-size hydraulic machine operating in a realistic environment.},

The SlothBot is a solar-powered, slow-paced, energy-efficient robot-hence its name-capable of moving on a mesh of wires by switching between branching wires. Unlike ground mobile robots or aerial robots employed in environmental monitoring applications, the use of wire-traversing robots allows for longer-term deployment because of the significantly lower energy consumption. Wire-traversing, coupled with the use of solar panels, facilitates the self-sustainability of the SlothBot. Locomotion and wire-switching maneuvers are performed in a fail-safe fashion, inasmuch the robot is always firmly attached to the wires, even when switching between branching wires. This is achieved by employing a two-body structure featuring an actuated decoupling mechanism. In this paper we show the design and the motion control of the SlothBot, together with the results of long-term monitoring experiments.},

        abstract = {Natural rubber is widely used in human life because of its excellent quality. At present, manual tapping is still the main way to obtain natural rubber. There is a sore need for intelligent tapping devices in the tapping industry, and the autonomous navigation technique is of great importance to make rubber-tapping devices intelligent. To realize the autonomous navigation of the intelligent rubber-tapping platform and to collect information on a rubber forest, the sparse point cloud data of tree trunks are extracted by the low-cost LiDAR and a gyroscope through the clustering method. The point cloud is fitted into circles by the Gauss-Newton method to obtain the center point of each tree. Then, these center points are threaded through the Least Squares method to obtain the straight line, which is regarded as the navigation path of the robot in this forest. Moreover, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm is adopted to obtain the robot's position. In a forest with different row spacings and plant spacings, the heading error and lateral error of this robot are analyzed and a Fuzzy Controller is applied for the following activities: walking along one row with a fixed lateral distance, stopping at fixed points, turning from one row into another, and collecting information on plant spacing, row spacing, and trees' diameters. Then, according to the collected information, each tree's position is calculated, and the geometric feature map is constructed. In a forest with different row spacings and plant spacings, three repeated tests have been carried out at an initial speed of 0.3 m/s. The results show that the Root Mean Square (RMS) lateral errors are less than 10.32 cm, which shows that the proposed navigation method provides great path tracking. The fixed-point stopping range of the robot can meet the requirements for automatic rubber tapping of the mechanical arm, and the average stopping error is 12.08 cm. In the geometric feature map constructed by collecting information, the RMS radius errors are less than 0.66 cm, and the RMS plant spacing errors are less than 11.31 cm. These results show that the method for collecting information and constructing a map recursively in the process of navigation proposed in the paper provides a solution for forest information collection. The method provides a low-cost, real-time, and stable solution for forest navigation of automatic rubber tapping equipment, and the collected information not only assists the automatic tapping equipment to plan the tapping path, but also provides a basis for the informationization and precise management of a rubber plantation.},

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is diﬃcult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with diﬀerent robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM conﬁgurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.},

        abstract = {Many popular problems in robotics and computer vision including various types of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment (BA) can be phrased as least squares optimization of an error function that can be represented by a graph. This paper describes the general structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. Our system has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be speciﬁed in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while being general g2o offers a performance comparable to implementations of stateof-the-art approaches for the speciﬁc problems.},

        abstract = {Learning models of the environment is one of the fundamental tasks of mobile robots since maps are needed for a wide range of robotic applications, such as navigation and transportation tasks, service robotic applications, and several others. In the past, numerous efﬁcient approaches to map learning have been proposed. Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives on a plane. In this paper, we present a highly efﬁcient maximum likelihood approach that is able to solve 3D as well as 2D problems. Our approach addresses the so-called graph-based formulation of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as an extension of Olson’s algorithm [27] towards non-ﬂat environments. It applies a novel parameterization of the nodes of the graph that signiﬁcantly improves the performance of the algorithm and can cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped area and not to the length of the trajectory. Furthermore, our approach is able to appropriately distribute the roll, pitch and yaw error over a sequence of poses in 3D mapping problems. We implemented our technique and compared it to multiple other graph-based SLAM solutions. As we demonstrate in simulated and in real world experiments, our method converges faster than the other approaches and yields accurate maps of the environment.},

        abstract = {While mobile LiDAR sensors are increasingly used to scan in ecology and forestry applications, reconstruction and characterisation are typically carried out offline (to the best of our knowledge). Motivated by this, we present an online LiDAR system which can run on a handheld device to segment and track individual trees and identify them in a fixed coordinate system. Segments relating to each tree are accumulated over time, and tree models are completed as more scans are captured from different perspectives. Using this reconstruction we then fit a cylinder model to each tree trunk by solving a least-squares optimisation over the points to estimate the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of the trees. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can estimate DBH to within \${\textbackslash}sim\$7 cm accuracy for 90\% of individual trees in a forest (Wytham Woods, Oxford)},

        abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an essential feature in many applications of mobile vehicles. To solve the problem of poor positioning accuracy, single use of mapping scene, and unclear structural characteristics in indoor and outdoor SLAM, a new framework of tight coupling of dual lidar inertial odometry is proposed in this paper. Firstly, through external calibration and an adaptive timestamp synchronization algorithm, the horizontal and vertical lidar data are fused, which compensates for the narrow vertical field of view (FOV) of the lidar and makes the characteristics of vertical direction more complete in the mapping process. Secondly, the dual lidar data is tightly coupled with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to eliminate the motion distortion of the dual lidar odometry. Then, the value of the lidar odometry after correcting distortion and the pre-integrated value of IMU are used as constraints to establish a non-linear least-squares objective function. Joint optimization is then performed to obtain the best value of the IMU state values, which will be used to predict the state of IMU at the next time step. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
