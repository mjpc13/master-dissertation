This chapter introduces and explains the fundamentals to understand the rest of the work presented in this disseration.

\section{\acl*{SLAM} (\acs*{SLAM})}

From the beginning of civilization, mapping the surroundings has been a key concept for navigating the environment. In essence we faced the same problem as our ancestors: How do we map the environment and know our location within it? \acs*{SLAM} is the challenge of mapping the local environment of a moving entity (e.g. robot) and updating the map continuously as the entity moves throughout space. This is a massive problem to tackle on and of extreme importance to achieve robot autonomy in moving robots. A common way to solve this problem is to use a Kalman filter.

The Kalman filter is an iterative process, as shown in Fig. \ref*{fig: flowchart kalman}, that uses consecutive data input to quickly converge to the true value. Each iteration involves computing three values: the Kalman gain, the current estimate, and its uncertainty. The Kalman gain uses the previous uncertainty and the error in data. The estimate of the current iteration is computed with the new data input and the previous estimation, where the weight of each component is decided by the kalman gain. Once the current estimate has been calculated, the new uncertainty of the estimate is computed with the current estimate and kalman gain.

\section{\acs{ROS}}

An effective robotics project cannot be achieved by just having sensors and physical components; rather, one must have a clever communication system between sensors and processes. Although such complex systems can be built from scratch, it is not worthwhile when software like \acs*{ROS} is available.

Although the name \acl*{ROS} suggests that ROS is an operating system, this is not the case.  In a way, \acs*{ROS} is both middleware and a framework. The system provides a communication channel where messages can be easily subscribed, published and distributed, allowing quick integration between systems and components. Moreover, it provides features such as debugging, visualization, testing, logging, and configuration right out of the box. Additionally, ROS includes a number of useful packages for essential areas relevant to robotics such as movement, perception, and manipulation. The ROS community is also constantly evolving with the most recent developments in robotics, so libraries are always being added to ROS. In robotics, it is considered the standard platform for developing complex projects.
