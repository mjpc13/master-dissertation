\section{Mechanical Structure}

The mechanical structure was divided in two diferent components, the sensor box, responsible for housing all cameras and sensors and by the backpack, reponsible for housing the computing, battery and eletronic components.

\end{figure}


In order to comply with the modularity requirement, the LiDAR component was put on top, since it is relatively common to have 360degrees LiDARs.







To assure the integraty of the apparatus, stress and frequency tests were performed to the sensor box component. The stress tests were perform in the open source software FreeCAD, and it used the Gmsh to create the mesh and the Calculicx the backend engine resposible to compute the dislocations.

While these tests might not be entiretly precise, knowing the natural frequency modes of the apparatus is two degrees of magnitude above the walking frequency is reassuring.
